One of the most popular packages for visualizing your data is [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). It relies on the [grammar of graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf). There are many tutorials available for learning how to use ggplot to quickly and easily investigate and visualize your data:
 - [Tutorial from r-statistics.co](http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part1-With-R-Code.html)
 - [ggplot section of R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)
